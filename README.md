No, it's not.

"Avoid close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing."

Why are we making potentially dangerous and untested opensource medical equipment?
Because the rate of infection is so high, there's projections millions more will catch the virus, and the amount of cases will overwhelm the healthcare system to the point where some cases will go untreated which can lead to higher rates of mortality. There's already been a US shortage of N95 masks for the last week, the US is just now seeing outbreaks of cases and if hospital staff do not have supplies like masks to protect themselves then they too can be incapacitated by the virus, leading to higher mortality.

Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)
N95 masks offer the best protection, but they are in short supply, surgical masks can be used, but do not offer the same protection as a N95 mask

Supposedly you can wash them with bleach in water up to 40 times to renew them, this is untested and unverified
Also potentially use an oven to autoclave infected masks, or hydrogen peroxide, or microwave oven, all untested and unverified

Response to N95 Recycling: "Cheuk Kwong Ng: Don't clean and sterilize the one-time disposable 3-layer surgical mask. Any attempt to clean and steralize (streaming, UV, alcohol / bleach / soap solution) the one-time disposable 3-layer surgical mask will destroy the fibre of 3 layers as well as wear off the electrostatic attraction in the middle layer which is one of the major filteration principle of mask in addition to the physical barrier.
You can use a one-time 3-layer disposable surgical mask. If u can't get one, make a reusable cloth mask (http://diymask.site) with a piece of kitchen paper which can achieve N70 level which is protective enough for daily use"

# Prototype Testing
Several different independent people should test the latest version of an individual design before bringing a prototype to a medical expert to review it
If a medical expert says it provides utility then it should be reviewed by a legal expert and an engineer
then beyond that if a design satisfies all the above then people could potentially mass produce the solution using 3D printers or whatever else
